    <h2>Drum &amp; Bass(DnB)</h2>
    <h3><a href="index.html" class="back">HOME</a></h3>
    <p>Ah, Drum &amp; Bass(DnB), probably the most recognizable EDM 
      sub-genre. Its main feature is its unique drum beat which uses 
      breakbeats, which are looped, fast beat samples(about 165-185 
      BPM). Besides the beat, DnB uses synths, heavy bass with 
      sub-bass lines, and of course, synths. Old DnB tends to be kind 
      of slow and repetitive compared to the new DnB which tends to be 
      more aggressive with its bass and more EDM like(build-ups and 
      drops). To be honest, I don't really like DnB(new or old). Old 
      DnB, as mentioned, is too slow and repetative for my ADHD brain 
      and new DnB has good basslines but I don't think it goes well 
      with its unique breakbeat style. Where DnB really stands out for 
      me is one of its sub-genres: Dancefloor DnB. Dancefloor DnB is a 
      more lighter, melodic, and danceable version of modern DnB. 
      Dancefloor DnB is one of those feel-good music genres and it's 
      honestly one of my favorties music genres of all time. Other 
      sub-genres that I like include Drumstep, which I already 
      mentioned before, and Metal &amp; Bass which uses distorted 
      electric guitars, the DnB style breakbeat, and occasionally 
      harsh vocals. Some of my favorite artists include Feint, Maduk, 
      REAPER, Zardonic, etc. <br></p>
