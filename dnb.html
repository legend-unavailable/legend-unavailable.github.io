    <h2>Drum &amp; Bass(DnB)</h2>
    <h3><a href="index.html" class="back">HOME</a></h3>
    <p>Ah, Drum &amp; Bass(DnB), probably the most recognizable EDM 
      sub-genre. Its main feature is its unique drum beat which uses 
      breakbeats, which are looped, fast beat samples(about 165-185 
      BPM). Besides the beat, DnB uses heavy bass with 
      sub-bass lines, synths, and in some cases feature UK rap elements. 
      Modern DnB has a very gritty bass sound, similar to <a href="Dubstep.html">Dubstep</a> but 
      with a different tempo. This genre is actually closely associated 
      with cars and racing. The combination of the fast tempo and high 
      energy basslines perfectly matches the fast paced nature of many 
      popular racing games like <I>Need For Speed</I>, The <I>Forza Horizon</I> 
      series, and the <I>Asphalt</I> series. Personally, it took awhile for 
      me to enjoy this genre. The heavy basslines didn't sound good when 
      combined with its fast tempo, but recently I've been finding myself 
      enjoying more and more DnB, especially Dancefloor DnB. Dancefloor DnB is a 
      more lighter, melodic, and danceable version of modern DnB. 
      Dancefloor DnB keeps the same fast and high energy of DNB but replaces its 
      heavy bassline with a more melodic and danceable one. Dancefloor DnB is 
      currently one of my favorties music genres right now, it just make you feel 
      good. Other sub-genres that I like include Drumstep, which I've already 
      mentioned before, Liquid DnB, which replaces the heavy bass for a more 
      ambient and melodic groove, and Metal &amp; Bass which combines DnB with modern 
      heavy metal. This genre uses distorted electric guitars, the DnB style breakbeat, 
      and occasionally harsh vocals. Some of my favorite artists include Feint, Maduk, 
      REAPER, Zardonic, etc.<br></p>
