    <h2>Glitch Hop</h2>
    <h3><a href="index.html" class="back">HOME</a></h3>
    <p>I can almost guarantee you haven't heard of this sub-genre. 
      Glitch Hop doesn't have the same mainstream popularity as the 
      other sub-genres but it does have a small niche among the gaming 
      community. Glitch Hop is kind of a weird genre as its primary 
      characteristic is its use of broken/glitchy sounds which makes 
      it sound like it came from a video game. Its tempo is almost 
      always at 110 BPM but the style of beats can vary. Glitch Hop 
      is a versatile genre and as such, it can be mixed with other 
      genres. Some artists mix it with <a href="Dubstep.html">Dubstep</a> 
      which gives it that deep kick while others give it a hip-hop type 
      beat puting the hop in Glitch Hop. I'm not really knowledgeable 
      on Glitch Hop sub-genres but I do know that Lo-Fi Hip Hop is 
      derived from Glitch Hop as it has some glitch elements like that 
      vintage vinyl sound. Some personal favorite Glitch Hop artists 
      inlcude TheFatRat and Phaera.<br></p>
