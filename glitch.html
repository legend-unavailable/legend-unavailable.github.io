    <h2>Glitch Hop</h2>
    <h3><a href="index.html" class="back">HOME</a></h3>
    <p>I can almost guarantee you haven't heard of this sub-genre. 
      Glitch Hop doesn't have the same mainstream popularity as the 
      other EDM sub-genres but it does have a small niche among the 
      online gaming and anime community. Glitch Hop is kind of a weird 
      genre as its primary characteristics include its use of broken/glitchy 
      sounds effects, funk elements, and very distorted basslines. Its tempo 
      is almost always at 110 BPM but the style of beats can vary. Glitch Hop 
      is a versatile genre and as such, it can be mixed with other 
      genres. Some artists give it charcteristics of <a href="Dubstep.html">Dubstep</a> 
      which gives it that deep kick/snare drum pattern, while others give it 
      a bouncy like hip-hop type beat. Glitch Hop is a relatively new sub-genre 
      and so my knowledge on it is limited but I do know that Lo-Fi Hip Hop is 
      a sort of sub-genre of Glitch Hop as it has some glitch elements like a 
      vintage vinyl scratching sound. Some artists have started branching out into 
      this genre but some of my personal favorite Glitch Hop artists 
      inlcude TheFatRat and Phaera.<br></p>
