    <h2>House</h2>
    <h3><a href="index.html" class="back">HOME</a></h3>
    <p>Now we have arrived at arguably the biggest sub-genre of EDM: 
      House, or its sub-genres(we'll get to that). House music is very 
      minimalistic compared to 
      <a href="Dubstep.html" class="dub">Dubstep</a> and 
      <a href="trap.html" class="trap">Trap</a> and its most notable 
      characteristic is its beat. House music uses a bass drum and 
      hit-hats combination which I like to dub the "boots and cats" 
      (it'll make sense when you listen) as well as a synth lead. 
      House has a lot of sub-genres and most of them are as popular 
      or even more popular than House. Since there are a lot of them 
      I'll talk about my top three favorite sub-genres: Progressive 
      House, Electro House, and Bass House. Progressive House uses the 
      same type of beat as House but Progressive House slowly builds 
      ups its tempo unlike House. Now Electro House(also called Electro) 
      and Bass House are actually very, very similar, to the point 
      where I can't really differentiate the two. The only difference 
      I can give is that Bass House is more "bouncy". Some of my 
      favorite House artists(Prog, Electro, Bass) inlcude Knife Party, 
      GHASTLY, Tokyo Machine, Vicetone, etc.<br><br></p>
