    <h2>House</h2>
    <h3><a href="index.html" class="back">HOME</a></h3>
    <p>Now we have arrived at arguably the biggest sub-genre of EDM: 
      House, or its sub-genres(we'll get to that). House music is very 
      minimalistic compared to 
      <a href="Dubstep.html" class="dub">Dubstep</a> and 
      <a href="trap.html" class="trap">Trap</a> and its most notable 
      characteristic is its beat. House music uses a bass drum and hit-hats 
      combination, a 4/4 beat at around 125 BPM, and a synth lead. 
      House has a lot of sub-genres and most of them are as popular 
      or even more popular than House. Since there are a lot of them, 
      I'll talk about my top three favorite sub-genres: Progressive 
      House, Electro House, and Bass House. Progressive House uses the 
      same type of beat as House but Progressive House slowly builds 
      ups the synths and the beat and one of its key characteristics is its use 
      of uplifting and catchy melodies. Now Electro House (also called Electro) 
      and Bass House are actually very, very similar. They both carry that 4/4 
      signature beat and they both share the same energetic and danceable bassline.
      However one very subtle difference between the two is that Bass House's bass 
      is darker and heavier in a sense. Electro House can have a heavy bassline as 
      well but usually its bass is more energetic, "bouncy" if you will. These two 
      sub-genres are very popular and are played by huge artists often at big 
      music festivals. Some of my favorite House artists(Prog, Electro, Bass) inlcude Knife Party, 
      GHASTLY, Tokyo Machine, Vicetone, Avicii, etc.<br><br></p>
