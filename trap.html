    <h2>Trap</h2>
    <h3><a href="index.html" class="back">HOME</a></h3>
    <p>Trap is very simple. It's the product of combining regular 
      hip hop like trap with the EDM style of music(build-ups and drops). As for 
      its characteristics, it uses the same beats, snares, kicks, etc. 
      that trap uses as well as the same bass samples(808s), but it 
      combines these with <a href="Dubstep.html">Dubstep</a>-like 
      sounds and Electro sounds. This genre was insanely popular in the 
      early and mid 2010s but has unfortunately died down in recent years 
      although there are some artists that still make trap. Some sub-genres 
      that I know of include Hybrid Trap, a combination of 
      <a href="Dubstep.html">Dubstep</a> and Trap, and Hard Trap, 
      which is less melodic and has a unique high pitched sound called 
      a supersaw. Even though it's not a sub-genre of Trap, I 
      thought I should still talk about Future Bass. Future Bass is 
      very similar to Trap in that they share the same style of beats and 
      synths. Future Bass however, has a more melodic bass and synth, is 
      more upbeat, and they usually have a dreamy and atmospheric feeling to it.
      It has its own sub-genres as well, although I don't listen or know Future 
      Bass that well yet. Some of my favorite Trap artists include 
      Yellow Claw, DJ Snake, Dirty Audio, etc. and even though I 
      don't listen to Future Bass that much, some noticable artists 
      inlcude San Holo, Marshmello, and Slushii.<br><br></p>
