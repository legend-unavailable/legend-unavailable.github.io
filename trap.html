    <h2>Trap</h2>
    <h3><a href="menu.html" class="back">HOME</a></h3>
    <p>Trap is very simple. It's the product of combining regular trap with the EDM style of music(build-ups and drops). As for its characteristics, it uses the same beats, snares, kicks, etc. that trap uses as well as the same bass samples(808s), but it combines these with <a href="Dubstep.html">Dubstep</a>-like sounds and Electro sounds. Some sub-genres that I know of are Hybrid Trap, a combination of <a href="Dubstep.html">Dubstep</a> and Trap although it leans more towards Trap, and Hard Trap, which is less melodic and has that unique high pitched sound which is hard to describe. Even though it's not a sub-genre I thought I should still talk about Future Bass. Future Bass is very similar to Trap with the only differences that I can tell is that it's less agressive, more melody focused, and has that unique bubbly bass. It has its own sub-genres although I'm not well versed in those. Some of my favorite Trap artists include Yellow Claw, Psychic Type, Dirty Audio, etc. and even though I don't listen to Future Bass that much, some noticable artists inlcude San Holo, Marshmello, and Slushii.<br><br></p>
