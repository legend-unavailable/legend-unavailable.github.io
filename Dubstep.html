    <h2>Dubstep</h2>
    <h3><a href="index.html" class="back">HOME</a></h3>
    <p>Dubstep is usually what comes to mind when talking about any 
      electronic music, however the "Dubstep" that most people know 
      isn't really dubstep but we'll get to that. Dubstep or Classical 
      Dubstep, for those that want the correct term, started in the UK 
      durting the 90s and was at its peak in the 2000s. It is 
      charcterized by a unqiue "deep" kick and a deep "wobbly" 
      sub-bass. Now, modern Dubstep is not the same as Classical 
      Dubstep. Why do I say that? The Dubstep that most people imagine 
      is very different from Classical Dubstep, to the point that it's 
      often considered a different sub-genre. This sub-genre is called 
      Brostep and its differences are that it has a lot of influences 
      from Metal and has a very agressive and artificial/robotic 
      sounding bass. Other sub-genres include Drumstep, which is a 
      combination of mainstream Dubstep and <a href="dnb.html">DnB</a> 
      which gives it a faster tempo, and Melodic Dubstep which, as the 
      name implies, has a nice melodic bassline. Some of my personal 
      favorite atists include Skrillex, RIOT, Bossfight, and MitiS.<br><br></p>
