    <h2>Dubstep</h2>
    <h3><a href="index.html" class="back">HOME</a></h3>
    <p>Dubstep is one of the most popular EDM sub-genres and for 
      good reason too. Its slowed down kick and snare drum beat, which 
      has a tempo of about 70 BPM, as well as its gritty and heavy bass 
      is what makes modern dubstep unique. Historically, dubstep goes way 
      back. "Classical" dubstep emerged in the UK during the 90s and during 
      this time dubstep was a lot more minimalistic. Its still had the kick 
      and snare pattern but it had a very simple sub-bass which is very 
      different from modern dubstep. By the time the late 2000s and early 
      2010s arrived, dubstep reached mainstream popularity and had changed 
      from what it orginally was. During this time, its basslines become 
      louder, more pronounced, and for lack of a better word, more chaotic. 
      Modern dubstep had been influenced by other genres like heavy metal and 
      had changed so much that it by the mid 2010s it was given a new name: 
      Brostep. This sub-genre of dubstep is what most people imagine when they 
      hear the word "dubstep". Brostep is often characterized as having a very 
      agressive and artificial/robotic sounding bass. Other dubstep sub-genres 
      include Drumstep, which is a combination of Brostep and 
      <a href="dnb.html">DnB</a> which gives it a faster tempo, and Melodic 
      Dubstep which keeps some of the agression of Brostep but combines it with 
      melodic and emotional elements. Some of my personal favorite atists include 
      Skrillex, RIOT, Zomboy, and MitiS.<br><br></p>
